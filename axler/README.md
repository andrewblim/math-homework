Answers for Sheldon Axler's [_Linear Algebra Done Right_](http://linear.axler.net/), 3rd edition. 

I was directed to this book by some discussion I read online that this book was how linear algebra "clicked" for some people. I've long felt that I could benefit from giving myself a back-to-basics, full-on refresh of linear algebra, so I bought it with the intention of going through it carefully and doing all the exercises.

The notable feature of this book is that determinants are not covered until the end. I have also been encouraged by the book's willingness to hand you a few exercises where you have to manipulate actual numbers, in addition to the more usual proofs. Forcing yourself to do these is a nice way to avoid glossing over things that you've only told yourself that you understand, and haven't actually understood.
